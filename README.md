Our intention was to create a high-quality project. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to dedicate enough time to it due to a heavy workload. We are aware that there are many aspects that could be improved. We also had ideas for adding new features, such as a history section where users could view the results of previous games.
We chose React as the language for this project because we had never done a project with it and we believe that learning to program with it will be highly valuable for our future.
